Description:
This notebook was made to visualize the Qualtrics GEO101 lab survey results for the University of Alabama's Department of Geological Sciences.

The survey.ipynb notebook imports the raw Qualtrics spreadsheet that should be located in data. This spreadsheet should be saved as a .csv with "Use Choice Text" selected. Some manually data cleaning is necessary, like making sure all the names are spelled correctly and consistently, making sure there are no spaces after the names, etc. The only input necessary to specify is the survey_file path, if the results are saved under a name other than "survey_results.csv". This notebook visualizes results by question and by TA, making distributions, comparisons, and performance presentations as simple as running a notebook.
